## Quick Start

#### 1. Get the latest version

You can start by cloning the latest version of React Dashboard on your
local machine by running:

$ git clone git@github.kyndryl.net:Wei-Hua-Xu/SDM-Cloud-CreateCase-Demo.git MyApp
$ cd MyApp
```

#### 2. Run `npm install`

#### 3. Run `yarn install`

This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed
in [package.json](package.json) file.

#### 4. Run `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. Whenever you modify any of the source files inside the `/src` folder,
the module bundler ([Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)) will recompile the
app on the fly and refresh all the connected browsers.

#### 5. Run `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
